## AI Backend
The backend provides prompt-driven AI functionality for:
- Summarizing patient call transcripts
- Assigning triage urgency levels (routine, semi-urgent, urgent)
- Communicating results to the main application backend

## Modelling
The modelling pipeline focuses on classical ML baselines trained on structured triage data.

Implemented models:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

These models serve as baselines and evaluation references alongside LLM-based triage logic.
